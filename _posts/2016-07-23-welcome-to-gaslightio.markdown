We started gaslight.io because while there are a few great highlighters for the web, none of them are open source and customizable. We want to make it easy to build the next highlighter on the web, and decided to build one out in the open.

Check out the [gaslight docs][gaslight-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of gaslight. File all bugs/feature requests at [gaslight's GitHub repo][gaslight-gh].
